Overall Design Summary
There are two Account Manager classes.
A single Account object is created and passed one by one to both managers.
Each manager:
    Fills account details
    Displays account details
This setup is used to compare weak vs strong encapsulation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AccountManager1 (Weak Encapsulation)
1._var indicates protected attributes (by convention), meant to be accessed only within the class or related classes.

2.fill_account_data(acc) directly sets protected variables inside the Account object.

3.display_account_data(acc) directly reads protected variables from the Account object.

4.The design follows separation of responsibility:
    Account → holds data
    AccountManager1 → performs operations on the account

5.AccountManager1 directly accesses protected variables, bypassing getters/setters.
6.This results in weak encapsulation, as data hiding is violated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AccountManager2 (Strong Encapsulation)
8.AccountManager2 does not access protected variables (_var) at all.
9.It interacts only with public properties (acc_no, name, balance).
10. var → public
    _var → protected
    __var → private (name-mangled)
11. AccountManager2 accesses data indirectly through properties, ensuring rules are applied.
12.This demonstrates proper use of encapsulation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Account Class (True Encapsulation)

14.Uses protected variables (_acc_no, _name, _balance) for internal data storage → Data Hiding.
15.Uses @property methods to provide controlled access to internal data.
16.@setter methods enforce validation and business rules (e.g., bank code prefix).
17. balance property returns computed value, not raw balance.
18. Interest calculation is hidden from the caller → Data Abstraction + Encapsulation.
19. compute_interest() represents hidden/internal behavior.
    External code does not depend on how interest is calculated.
    Logic can change without affecting managers.
20.Account class exposes what to access, not how it is implemented.


Final Conclusion:

The Account class achieves true encapsulation by storing data in protected variables and exposing it through public properties with validation and business logic.
AccountManager1 violates encapsulation by directly accessing protected members, resulting in weak data protection.
AccountManager2 respects encapsulation by interacting only through public interfaces, ensuring controlled access, data hiding, and abstraction.
